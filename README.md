Welcome to the "Bard Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the Bard model.

The [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) model is a large language model trained by Google that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Bard.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for Bard. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

> I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first command is pwd
